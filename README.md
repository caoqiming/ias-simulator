# IAS simulator

This is a simulator for the IAS computer.

This simulator can execute programs of IAS computer. This tool can helps you understand how IAS computer works and debug IAS programs you wrote.

> But please note that this program is not a circuit-level simulation. Each instruction and the operation of fetching instructions are only implemented at the software level.

## What is IAS computer

The first generation of computers (ex: ENIAC: the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer) used vacuum tubes for digital logic elements and memory. Perhaps the most famous first-generation computer, is the IAS computer (Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton).

This idea is attributed to the mathematician John Von Neumann, and the first publication of this idea was for a computer called the EDVAC. All of todayâ€™s computers have this same general structure and function and are referred to as Von Neumann machines.
